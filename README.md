Configuration code (see [.openshift](https://github.com/rajeakshay/raje-akshay-web-dev/tree/master/.openshift) directory) to run a specific version of Node (v4.4.4 LTS) on RedHat's Openshift PaaS has been sourced from ramr's excellent work [here] (https://github.com/ramr/nodejs-custom-version-openshift).

Big thanks to everyone who collaborated and contributed to this repository!
